# LemonTree

LemonTree is a link aggregator tool where a user can save a list of all their important links and share it with others. It works similar to about.me and linktree.

Once you clone the repo, run the `bundle install` command, followed by `yarn install` and then start the rails server with `rails s`. You'll need to do db migrations, follow the standard Rails guides for help.

All the though process that went behind can found in the live stream, during which the app was built.
